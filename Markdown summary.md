Mardown... it supports...
# Headers
...in six levels, like HTML...
## Header zwei
### Header three
#### Header iv
##### Header cinco
###### Header 6
...including an underlined markup style using equals signs for header level one, and underlines for header level two.

It supports **bold**, *italic*, _underscored_, and even ~strikethrough~ text with double-asterisks, asterisks, underlines, and tilde characters.

List support includes...
* Lists
  1. Ordered lists, with numbers
  2. Unordered lists, with...
    * askterisks
    - minuses
    + or plusses
  3. Paragraphs within the lists and sublists with double spaces.
    Including line breaks without creating additional paragraphs with trailing double spaces.  
    Like so.

Links can be made inline using square brackets and parenthesis, or reference style with multiple square brackets. (Examples not included here.)

Images are similar, but with an exclamation point at the start. (Again, no examples here.)

Inline code uses `backtick characters`.

```javascript
// Triple backticks are good for blocks of code, and language can be specified immediately after the opening triple backticks for syntax highlighting.
var s = "Like so...";
alert(s);
```

Tables (not in core Markdown) are built graphically using pipe separators and pipe/dash combinations to separate the header from the regular rows.

| Tables | Are | Supported
| ------:| --- |:---------
| This column      | Column alignment              | This column
| is aligned right | is achieved in the underlined | is aligned left.
| ... | section using colons on either side of the | ...
| ... | dashes, left, right, or both.              | ...

> Blockquotes are useful, using greater-than operator.

Raw HTML may work.

And horizontal rules can be achieved with triple hyphens, asterisks, or underscores.
